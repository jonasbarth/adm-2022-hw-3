0	Clock Tower Building	astounding timepieces,architectural oddities,architecture	205	859	Opened in 1898, the Clock Tower Building was one of the many gilded wonders created in Manhattan by the architectural team of McKim, Mead & White. It was capped, as the name suggests, with a beautiful mechanical clock, the city’s largest, with “more than a dozen gears, ranging in diameter from a half inch to two feet…attached to a hammer that hourly strikes a 5,000-pound bronze bell.” The home office of New York Life Insurance Company until they moved uptown in 1927 to their new headquarters in Madison Square, the building housed other offices until it was purchased by New York City in 1967 for use by various municipal agencies and courts. But by the 1970s the clock tower itself, if not the building, had been long abandoned in that peculiar New York habit of forgetting its architectural treasures. The clock itself had stopped working, the glass was broken, and the clock tower had been left to molder. In 1972 the space just below the clock—originally planned as architect Stanford White’s entertaining room, before he was murdered for “entertaining” the murderer’s wife—was turned into the Clocktower Gallery, part of alternative space movement leader Alanna Heiss’s efforts to find new unusual art spaces in New York City. The now legendary Clocktower Gallery brought artists in close contact with the clock, and many incorporated it into their art, including one artist who hung naked from the clock and bathed himself with a hose. Later, the gallery would also become the broadcast center for an art-focused internet radio station. Happily, the old clock found new life in 1979 when municipal workers Marvin Schneider, Eric Reiner, and George Whaley convinced the city to let them repair it. Despite having little in the way of horological experience, they succeeded and today Schneider is the city’s clockmaster—the first in many decades. Every Wednesday morning, Schneider would make a house call to the Clock Tower Building and hoist two 800-pound weights whose slow descent would power the clock for the week. Visitors to the art gallery could climb a spiral staircase to view the workings of the now perfectly-operating timepiece. Unfortunately, like so many other New York City attractions, after 9/11 the city-owned clock tower was made off-limits to visitors. Even more unfortunate, the Clocktower Gallery was forced to close in 2013 when the city decided to sell the building to developers. Today, the Clock Tower Building is surrounded by scaffolding as a five-year condominium conversion finally nears completion. Preservationists were horrified in 2015 when they learned that the developers intended to electrify the 19th century clock and turn the clock tower, a designated interior landmark, into a triplex penthouse (thus forever cutting off its access to the public). After a two-year legal battle, a court ruled in favor of the preservationists and the penthouse plans were scrapped. If you’ve got a few million dollars to spare, you can now purchase your very own apartment in the spectacular Clock Tower Building. And maybe, just maybe, the clock tower itself will someday once again be open to visitors. In the meantime, admire the Gilded Age wonder as you pass by on Broadway and see if you can catch a glimpse of that wonderful clock 13 stories up.

1	City Hall Station	abandoned,infrastructure,subterranean,architectural oddities,subterranean sites,subways,architecture	1826	8572	The first New York City subway was built and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and opened on October 27, 1904, to the joy of New York elevated train and streetcar riders. The City Hall station on the IRT local track was lavished with fine architectural details, including glass tiles and large chandeliers. However, the Gustavino vaulted ceilings and skylights were lost on busy commuters, and the stop was one of the least-used in the system. It was the only station that did not have turnstiles installed by 1923, and the nearby Brooklyn Bridge stop was frequented by the express train and closer to connecting streetcars. Because of the curved platform, cars with center doors could not be used at this station unless they had specially modified door controls which allowed just the end doors to be opened. In 1945, the station was closed when platforms along the line were being lengthened to accommodate longer trains, and the number of passengers using this station dwindled to very few. Another factor leading to the decline of the station’s use was the fact that a person boarding the train at City Hall with a station intended destination below City Hall or in Brooklyn would wind up on the uptown platform at the Brooklyn Bridge station. They would then have to go upstairs and down to the downtown platform to continue their journey. It was much easier to walk the short distance at street level to the Brooklyn Bridge station. Up until the late 1990’s the passengers on the Lexington Avenue Local (today’s 6 train) had to disembark from the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop. That is no longer the case. The skylights have been reopened, and the station lights turned back on. While passengers can not get out of the train and experience the City Hall Station as they once might have, they can stay on the train as it loops around on those tracks and heads back north. The New York City Transit Museum hosts periodic tours of the abandoned station; however, you must be a member of the museum to attend. Check the website for details.

2	Museum of Sex	museums and collections,erotic,museums,phallic	1730	3126	It’s amazing that it took so long for New York to catch up to the rest of the world. Sex museums were popular in Europe in the 1960s, and a museum dedicated entirely to sex first premiered in America in (where else?) San Francisco in the 1970s. However the sex museum in San Francisco was short lived, leaving all of America without a sex museum for nearly three decades. Finally, in 2002, the Museum of Sex in New York City stepped up with a singular mission: fill that void. Founded by Daniel Gluck with the aim of turning a scholarly eye to a subject often considered vulgar or taboo, the museum features over 15,000 artifacts, including art, photographs, movies, clothing and inventions–all relating to sex, of course. The museum is only open to those over 18, and the gift shop was voted the “best place to buy a last-minute gift,” in 2008 by the New York press. When Gluck tried to get non-profit status for his museum, he was rejected by the NYC Board of Regents, who said his idea made a mockery of the concept of museums. Since Gluck refused to accept sponsorship from the porn industry, ticket prices are steep. Exhibits have included, “US Patent Office Sex Inventions,” and “Sex Lives of Animals,” among many others.
